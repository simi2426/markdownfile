# HW3 Approach

For this project, I first started out by creating a random loop to generate a set of numbers bound to 100, but to make it simpler, I created my own array list of six integers. Then, I created 'query', the integer we would be scanning the array to find. 

Next, I created contains() to actually inspect the array for the integer 'query'. I decided to make a for loop, because I couldn't really think of another way to inspect a set of numbers for an integer that wouldn't be too many lines of code.
